Here is a puzzle scenario:

You see a moment in time: a man with brown hair appears to be pushing a man with black hair off a cliff. In the background, you can see two islets in the sea. Nearby the men on the cliff next to a tent, there are two bags. 

The yellow bag contains two bags of gems, and a small pack of tabacco.
The grey bag contains one bag of gems, a golden statuette, and a small bag of medical instruments and medicine.

The brown haired man is saying "I knew what you were scheming, you fiend!"

The brown haired man has the following items on him:
- A pipe
- A dagger
- A contract

The black haired man has the following items on him:
- A scalpel
- A medicine bottle
- Another copy of the same contract that the brown haired man has
- A map of an island, with the following details:
	- At the centre of the island is a cross marked "Ruins of Xenopolis"
	- To the east, next to a small islet off the coast of the main island, is "Bay of Shadows"
	- To the west, next to two small islets off the coast of the main island, is "Horn of Thumb"
	- To the north, at the tip of the main island with no marked features nearby, is "Horn of Finger"
