There is a large glass sphere that's as tall as a person, firmly held in place on the floor, with a small hand sized hole at the top. Inside the sphere is a paper lottery ticket. You have a string that's the radius of the sphere, an eraser, some glue, and a hair drier. How do you get the ticket without breaking or moving the sphere?

Think the problem through step by step.
