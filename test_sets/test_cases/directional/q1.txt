If I am standing in London, facing south east, is Edinburgh more to my left or my right, and more in front of me or behind me? 

Think the problem through step by step, then when you have come to a final conclusion, put the answer to whether it is to my left or right inside <lateral></lateral> tags (with just the word left or right inside), and whether it is behind me or in front of me in <axial></axial> tags (again, with just the word front or behind inside the tags).
