Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

1) What type of attire is the blue outfit?
The description states that the portrait on the wall shows a "wealthy man dressed in a blue outfit, holding a glass of wine and a knife, with a small roast chicken on a plate before him, smiling." This suggests that the blue outfit is a dining or formal attire.

2) What type of attire is the white outfit?
The white outfit hanging on the chair has "many strange yellow splotches on it, and a couple of strange instruments coming out of one pocket." This suggests that the white outfit is some kind of research or laboratory attire, likely used for experiments or scientific work.

3) What type of attire is the brown outfit?
The man on the bed is wearing a "brown outfit." This is likely his everyday or casual attire.

4) What is the full name of the man on the bed?
The diary entry mentions "Sebastian Cloudsley," so the full name of the man on the bed is Sebastian Cloudsley.

5) What happened?
Based on the evidence, it appears that Sebastian Cloudsley, Lord of Woodshire, passed away in his bed. The cause of death was a head wound, which occurred when he fell from the ladder while he was retrieving a book from the tall bookcase, likely related to his research on "Lead Poisoning" by Henry Clover.

The full answer is:
"Sebastian Cloudsley, Lord of Woodshire, passed away in his bed. The cause of death was a head wound which occurred when he fell from a ladder while he was retrieving a book from the tall bookcase, likely related to his research on 'Lead Poisoning' by Henry Clover."
