Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

1) Where is the men's camp?
From the information provided, we can see that the men are near a tent, and there are two bags (a yellow bag and a grey bag) next to the tent. This suggests that the men's camp is located near the cliff, where the incident is taking place.
The answer is: The men's camp is at the cliff of Monkey Paw Island.

2) What is the brown haired man's full name?
The brown haired man is holding a contract that has the name "Esquire Albert Cloudsley" on it. Therefore, the brown haired man's full name is Albert Cloudsley.

3) What is the black haired man's full name?
The black haired man is holding a contract that has the name "Doctor Oberon Geller" on it. Therefore, the black haired man's full name is Oberon Geller.

4) What happened?
From the information provided, we can see that the brown haired man (Albert Cloudsley) is pushing the black haired man (Oberon Geller) off a cliff, and he is saying "I knew what you were scheming, you fiend!" This suggests that Albert Cloudsley is pushing Oberon Geller off the cliff, likely because he believes Oberon was scheming or plotting something.
The answer is: Albert Cloudsley pushed Oberon Geller from a cliff in the Bay of Shadows on Monkey Paw Island.
