Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

1) The blue outfit is likely the man's dining attire. In the portrait, he is wearing a blue outfit while holding a glass of wine and a knife, with a roast chicken in front of him, suggesting it's what he wears for meals.

2) The white outfit with strange yellow splotches and instruments in the pocket is likely his researching attire. The splotches and instruments suggest it's used for some kind of scientific research or experiments.

3) The brown outfit the man on the bed is wearing is likely his hunting attire. In the diary, it mentions he changed into his hunting attire at 16:00 before going to hunt badgers.

4) The man's full name is likely Sebastian Cloudsley. This name is mentioned on the page on the desk where he refers to himself in the first person.

5) Now, let's piece together what happened:
- Sebastian Cloudsley is Lord of one of the three places on the map - Woodshire, Crowtower, or Blackfield. The building we're in seems to be next to a body of water, which matches the description of Blackfield on the map.
- He passed away in his bed, as that's where his body is found.
- The cause of death seems to be a head wound, given the description of his badly wounded, bloody head.
- This likely occurred from a fall, as there's a ladder next to the bookshelf with a book on lead poisoning half pulled out, suggesting he was on the ladder reaching for that book when he fell.
- He was likely researching when this happened, as the diary mentions him changing into his researching attire in the evening after dinner.

Therefore, the answer to question 5 is:
"Sebastian Cloudsley, Lord of Blackfield, passed away in his bed. The cause of death was a head wound which occurred when he fell from a ladder while he was researching."
