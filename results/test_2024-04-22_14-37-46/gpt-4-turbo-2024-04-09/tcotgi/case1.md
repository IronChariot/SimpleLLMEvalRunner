1) To determine where the men's camp is located, we can use the details from the map and the description of the scene. The map details include "Horn of Thumb" next to two small islets off the coast of the main island. The scene description mentions two islets in the sea visible from the cliff where the men are. Therefore, the men's camp is likely near this location. Thus, the answer is:
   **The men's camp is at the Horn of Thumb of Monkey Paw Island.**

2) From the contract, we know the names of the two parties involved in the expedition. The brown haired man is referred to as Esquire Albert Cloudsley in the contract. Therefore:
   **The brown haired man's full name is Albert Cloudsley.**

3) Similarly, the contract identifies the black haired man as Doctor Oberon Geller. Therefore:
   **The black haired man's full name is Oberon Geller.**

4) To understand what happened, we consider the items each man has, their statements, and the contract. Albert Cloudsley, the brown haired man, accuses Oberon Geller, the black haired man, of scheming. Given the context of the contract and the items found, it seems there might have been a dispute over the division of the treasures or the discovery itself. Albert, feeling threatened or betrayed by Oberon's actions (possibly related to the golden statuette found in Oberon's bag, which according to the contract should belong to Oberon), reacts by pushing Oberon off the cliff. Therefore:
   **Albert Cloudsley pushed Oberon Geller from a cliff in the Horn of Thumb on Monkey Paw Island.**
