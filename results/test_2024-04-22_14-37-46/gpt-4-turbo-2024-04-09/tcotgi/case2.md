1) **What type of attire is the blue outfit?**
   - The blue outfit is described as being worn by a wealthy man holding a glass of wine and a knife, with a roast chicken before him, and he is smiling. This suggests that the blue outfit is a dining attire, as it is associated with eating and enjoying a meal.

2) **What type of attire is the white outfit?**
   - The white outfit has many strange yellow splotches and strange instruments coming out of one pocket. This description, along with the yellow splotches, suggests that the white outfit is a researching attire, possibly used for experiments or scientific work where the splotches could be stains from chemicals or other substances used in research.

3) **What type of attire is the brown outfit?**
   - The man on the bed is wearing a brown outfit. Given the context of the room and the presence of a book entitled "Lead Poisoning," it is likely that the brown outfit is a casual or everyday attire, possibly worn while the man was reading or moving around his personal chamber.

4) **What is the full name of the man on the bed?**
   - The diary entry is signed by "Sebastian Cloudsley." Given that this is the only name mentioned in the scenario and the diary is found in the room, it is reasonable to conclude that the full name of the man on the bed is Sebastian Cloudsley.

5) **What happened?**
   - Answer: "Sebastian Cloudsley, Lord of Woodshire, passed away in his bed. The cause of death was a head injury which occurred when he fell from a ladder while he was trying to reach a book."
   - Explanation: The presence of the ladder next to the bed and the book "Lead Poisoning" half pulled out suggests that Sebastian was attempting to retrieve this book from the tall bookcase. The trail of blood between the door and the bed, along with the severe head wound, indicates that he likely fell from the ladder, hit his head, and managed to crawl to the bed where he succumbed to his injuries.
