2) The white outfit could be dining attire, hunting attire, researching attire, or sleeping attire. The fact that the white outfit has yellow splotches and strange instruments coming out of one pocket suggests that it is likely researching attire.

3) The brown outfit could be dining attire, hunting attire, researching attire, or sleeping attire. There is no direct evidence to suggest what type of attire the brown outfit is, so it could be any of the options.

4) The man on the bed could be Sebastian Cloudsley, based on the diary entry mentioning his name.

5) The building we are in could be Woodshire, Crowtower, or Blackfield. There is no direct evidence to definitively determine the name of the building we are in.

6) Based on the evidence provided, a possible answer to what happened could be: "Sebastian Cloudsley, Lord of Woodshire, passed away in his bed. The cause of death was a head wound which occurred when he fell from a ladder while he was trying to reach a book in the bookcase." This theory is supported by the fact that there is a ladder next to the bookcase, a book half pulled out of the bookcase, and a trail of blood leading from the bed to the door.
