Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

1) Where is the men's camp?
From the information provided, we can see that the men are near a cliff, with two islets in the sea in the background. Additionally, there is a tent and two bags near the men. Therefore, the men's camp is at the cliff of Monkey Paw Island.

2) What is the brown haired man's full name?
The brown haired man has a pipe, a dagger, and a contract. The contract is signed by "Esquire Albert Cloudsley", so the brown haired man's full name is Albert Cloudsley.

3) What is the black haired man's full name?
The black haired man has a scalpel, a medicine bottle, another copy of the contract, and a map of Monkey Paw Island. The contract is signed by "Doctor Oberon Geller", so the black haired man's full name is Oberon Geller.

4) What happened?
From the information provided, we can see that the brown haired man (Albert Cloudsley) is pushing the black haired man (Oberon Geller) off a cliff, and is saying "I knew what you were scheming, you fiend!" This suggests that Albert Cloudsley is pushing Oberon Geller off the cliff, likely because he believes Oberon was scheming or plotting something.

Therefore, the answer is:
"Albert Cloudsley pushed Oberon Geller from a cliff in the Bay of Shadows on Monkey Paw Island."
