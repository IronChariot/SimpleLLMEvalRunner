Let's break down the information and solve the problems step by step.

From the map, we can see that the men are on Monkey Paw Island, and the two islets in the background suggest that they are near the west coast of the island, possibly near the "Horn of Thumb" area.

1. The men's camp is at the Horn of Thumb of Monkey Paw Island.

From the contract, we can see that the brown-haired man's last name is Cloudsley, and the black-haired man's last name is Geller.

2. The brown haired man's full name is Albert Cloudsley.

3. The black haired man's full name is Oberon Geller.

Now, let's analyze the situation. The brown-haired man, Albert Cloudsley, is accusing the black-haired man, Oberon Geller, of scheming something. The presence of a scalpel and medicine bottle on Oberon suggests that he might be a doctor. The contract suggests that Oberon provided the map to the expedition site, and Albert funded the expedition.

Given the context, it's likely that Oberon was trying to cheat Albert out of his share of the valuables, possibly by using his medical skills to fake an injury or illness. Albert discovered Oberon's plan and confronted him, leading to the current situation.

4. Albert Cloudsley pushed Oberon Geller from a cliff in the Horn of Thumb of Monkey Paw Island.
