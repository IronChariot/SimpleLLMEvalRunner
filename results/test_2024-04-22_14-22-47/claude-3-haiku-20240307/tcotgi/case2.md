Alright, let's go through this step-by-step:

1) What type of attire is the blue outfit?
The description states that the portrait shows a "wealthy man dressed in a blue outfit, holding a glass of wine and a knife, with a small roast chicken on a plate before him, smiling." This suggests that the blue outfit is a dining or formal attire.

2) What type of attire is the white outfit?
The white outfit has "many strange yellow splotches on it, and a couple of strange instruments coming out of one pocket." This suggests that the white outfit is a research or laboratory attire, likely used for experiments or scientific work.

3) What type of attire is the brown outfit?
The man on the bed is wearing a "brown outfit." The description does not provide any further details about this outfit, but based on the context, it seems to be a general, everyday outfit.

4) What is the full name of the man on the bed?
The description does not provide the full name of the man on the bed. It only states that he is wearing a "brown outfit, and a ring with a ruby."

5) What happened? Answer of the form "A B, Lord of C, passed away in his bed. The cause of death was a D E which occurred when he fell from a F while he was G."
Based on the information provided, it seems that the man on the bed, Sebastian Cloudsley, passed away in his bed. The cause of death appears to be a head wound, as the description states that "the head wound is very bloody, and a trail of blood is visible between where he is on the bed and the door to the chamber." The book "Lead Poisoning" by Henry Clover, which is partially pulled out of the bookcase, suggests that the head wound may have been caused by lead poisoning, which could have occurred when Cloudsley fell from the ladder while trying to reach a book on the higher shelves of the bookcase.

Therefore, the answer would be:
"Sebastian Cloudsley, Lord of Woodshire, passed away in his bed. The cause of death was a fatal head wound which occurred when he fell from a ladder while he was reaching for a book."
