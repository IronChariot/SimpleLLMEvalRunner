Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

1) Where is the men's camp?
From the information provided, we can see that the men are near a tent, and there are two bags next to the tent. This suggests that the men's camp is located at the cliff next to the tent.
Therefore, the answer is: "The men's camp is at the cliff of Monkey Paw Island."

2) What is the brown haired man's full name?
The information does not explicitly state the brown haired man's full name. However, we can infer that his name is likely Albert Cloudsley, as he is mentioned in the contract as the party with rights to two-thirds of the valuables.
Therefore, the answer is: "The brown haired man's full name is Albert Cloudsley."

3) What is the black haired man's full name?
The information explicitly states that the black haired man's name is Oberon Geller, as he is mentioned in the contract as the party with rights to one-third of the valuables and any golden statues.
Therefore, the answer is: "The black haired man's full name is Oberon Geller."

4) What happened?
Based on the information provided, it appears that Albert Cloudsley (the brown haired man) pushed Oberon Geller (the black haired man) off the cliff on Monkey Paw Island. The contract suggests that they were involved in an expedition to the island, and the confrontation seems to be related to the terms of the agreement.
Therefore, the answer is: "Albert Cloudsley pushed Oberon Geller from a cliff in the Bay of Shadows on Monkey Paw Island."
