Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The map on the black haired man shows two islets off the west coast of the main island, next to a location marked "Horn of Thumb". The moment in time shows two islets in the sea in the background as the men struggle on the cliff. Therefore, the men's camp must be at the Horn of Thumb on the west side of Monkey Paw Island.

2) The contract shows two names: Albert Cloudsley and Oberon Geller. Albert Cloudsley is listed as "Esquire" and funded the expedition, while Oberon Geller is listed as "Doctor" and provided the map. The brown haired man has a pipe, which fits with him being the Esquire, while the black haired man has medical instruments, which fits with him being the Doctor. Therefore, the brown haired man's full name must be Albert Cloudsley.

3) Following the logic from (2), the black haired man must be Doctor Oberon Geller.

4) We can see that the brown haired man, Albert Cloudsley, is pushing the black haired man, Oberon Geller, off a cliff. They are at their camp which we determined is at the Horn of Thumb on Monkey Paw Island. Albert is accusing Oberon of scheming, likely because Oberon was entitled to any golden statues found, and there is a golden statuette in one of the bags at the camp. Putting this all together:

Esquire Albert Cloudsley pushed Doctor Oberon Geller from a cliff in the Horn of Thumb of Monkey Paw Island.
