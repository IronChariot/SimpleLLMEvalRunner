Okay, let's analyze the information provided and solve the problems step by step:

1. The blue outfit is likely the man's dining attire, as the portrait shows him wearing a blue outfit while holding a glass of wine and a knife, with a roast chicken on a plate before him.

2. The white outfit with strange yellow splotches and instruments in the pocket is likely the man's researching attire, as mentioned in his diary entry.

3. The brown outfit worn by the man on the bed is not specifically mentioned in the diary entry. However, since the diary mentions hunting attire, and the man went hunting badgers, it's likely that the brown outfit is his hunting attire.

4. The full name of the man on the bed is Sebastian Cloudsley, as mentioned in the text on the desk: "I, Sebastian Cloudsley, will share my humble contribution to the science of anatomy and chemistry."

5. To determine what happened, let's piece together the clues:
   - The man on the bed has a badly wounded, bloody head and is not breathing.
   - There is a trail of blood from the bed to the door, suggesting he was injured elsewhere and made his way to the bed.
   - A ladder is leaning against the tall bookcase, and a book about lead poisoning is half-pulled out just above the ladder, indicating he might have been on the ladder when the incident occurred.
   - The diary entry suggests he was researching something, likely related to his "contribution to the science of anatomy and chemistry."
   - The map on the wall shows three locations, but it's unclear if they are relevant to the incident.

Based on these clues, a possible answer to question 5 is:
"Sebastian Cloudsley, Lord of Woodshire (or Crowtower, or Blackfield), passed away in his bed. The cause of death was a head injury which occurred when he fell from a ladder while he was researching lead poisoning."
