1) **What type of attire is the blue outfit?**
   The blue outfit is described as being worn by a wealthy man holding a glass of wine and a knife, with a roast chicken before him, and he is smiling. This suggests that the blue outfit is a dining attire, as it is associated with a setting that involves eating and a formal presentation.

2) **What type of attire is the white outfit?**
   The white outfit has many strange yellow splotches and strange instruments coming out of one pocket. This description, along with the yellow splotches, suggests that the white outfit is a researching attire, likely used for scientific or chemical experiments, which could explain the stains and instruments.

3) **What type of attire is the brown outfit?**
   The man on the bed, who is deceased, is wearing a brown outfit. Given the context of the room and the presence of a book titled "Lead Poisoning," it is likely that the brown outfit is his casual or everyday attire, possibly worn while he was moving around his personal space or library.

4) **What is the full name of the man on the bed?**
   The diary entry mentions the name "Sebastian Cloudsley." Since this diary is found on the desk in the same room as the deceased man, it is reasonable to conclude that the full name of the man on the bed is Sebastian Cloudsley.

5) **What happened?**
   Based on the evidence, the answer could be formulated as: "Sebastian Cloudsley, Lord of Woodshire, passed away in his bed. The cause of death was a severe head injury which occurred when he fell from a ladder while he was trying to reach a book." The presence of the ladder next to the bookcase, the book "Lead Poisoning" half pulled out, and the trail of blood leading from the door to where he lay, supports the scenario of him falling while attempting to retrieve a book.
